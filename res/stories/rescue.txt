// ~ means the entry point ! means close the app * means there is no options
// scenarios block contains all possible choices in the story
// ^&^ is a keyword that chooses one of the two operands the left or the right on that is next to it for randomness in the story
// situation block contains the situation text and choices and next situations
// the parser doesn't look at any thing after the (:) in the (scenarios or situation) blocks so the numbering is optional
// any thing except what is in the (scenarios or situation) blocks is considered a comment by the parser so // is not necessary but i'm using them for aesthetic reasons
// Bad thing that i don't like that the randomness (^&^) keyword only works when the app restarts and i am to lazy to fix it there for it is a feature from now and on
